                        I am Yu Ru Li, graduated from the Department of Information Technology and Communication at Shih
                        Chien University. I have an optimistic personality, enjoy taking on challenging tasks, and
                        aspire to expand my learning beyond routine work to explore expertise in different fields.
                        What's more, I continuously strive to step out of my comfort zone courageously. Through ongoing
                        self-improvement, I hope to apply the knowledge and skills I have acquired from the past and
                        present stages of my career fully to my future endeavors.
                    </p>

                        I participated in the 95th batch of the Cloud Network and Smart Technology Employment
                        Development Program at the Institute for Information Industry and obtained the CCNA
                        certification during the course. At CloudMiner, I worked as a Cloud Operations Engineer, mainly
                        responsible for system maintenance, management, and troubleshooting. Due to my profound passion
                        for the cloud/automation field, I aspire to gain in-depth knowledge in this area and work
                        together with a team to achieve personal and organizational growth.
